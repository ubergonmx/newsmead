# View Binding

Always use `viewBinding` instead of `findViewByID(R.id.something)`

<br/>

By default, we will be using view binding, which is currently enabled in the gradle settings
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ app/build.gradle.kts
```kotlin
43         // Enable viewBinding
44         buildFeatures {
45             viewBinding = true
46         }
```

<br/>

# Reference (actual coding standard)

An excellent read to start: [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)

## Naming ids

When naming an id for a view, let's follow `<acronym><Name>` in camelCase format. Examples:

*   `tvArticleTitle` - A TextView with a name Article Title

*   `ivSourceImage` - An ImageView with a name Source Image
