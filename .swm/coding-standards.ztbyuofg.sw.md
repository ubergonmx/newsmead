# File Structure

The file structure in our codebase follows a specific convention to ensure consistency and organization. This section provides an overview of the file structure in our repository.

As seen in the code snippet from `path/to/snippet` (see snippet), the file structure is organized into different directories and files. Each directory serves a specific purpose and contains related files.

For example, the `src` directory is the main directory that contains all the source code files. Within the `src` directory, there are subdirectories such as `components`, `services`, and `utils`, which group related files together.

To add a new file or directory, follow the existing file structure and place the file in the appropriate directory. This helps maintain a logical organization and makes it easier to locate files.

It is important to note that the file structure may vary depending on the specific component or module being worked on. Therefore, it is recommended to refer to the relevant code snippets and existing files in the repository for a more detailed understanding of the file structure.

For more information on the file structure, refer to the code snippet from `path/to/snippet` (see snippet).

# Naming Conventions

In our codebase, we follow specific naming conventions to ensure consistency and readability. This section provides an overview of the naming conventions we use in our code.

## File Naming

When naming files, we use lowercase letters and separate words with hyphens. This helps improve readability and ensures consistency across our codebase. For example, a file named `example-file.ts` would follow our file naming convention.

## Variable Naming

When naming variables, we use camel case. This means that the first letter of the variable name is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter. For example, a variable named `exampleVariable` would follow our variable naming convention.

## Function Naming

When naming functions, we also use camel case. The function name should be descriptive and indicate its purpose. For example, a function named `calculateTotal` would follow our function naming convention.

## Class Naming

When naming classes, we use Pascal case. This means that each word in the class name starts with an uppercase letter. For example, a class named `ExampleClass` would follow our class naming convention.

## Constant Naming

When naming constants, we use uppercase letters and separate words with underscores. This helps distinguish constants from variables and makes them easily identifiable. For example, a constant named `MAX_VALUE` would follow our constant naming convention.

## Folder Structure

In our codebase, we organize files into logical folders to improve maintainability and organization. The folder structure follows a
